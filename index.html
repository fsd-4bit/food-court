      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>When I’m not cooking, you can find me gardening, practicing yoga, or exploring nature. I carry these practices into the kitchen to support mindful eating for optimal health. I believe in sustainability and follow no-waste practices for plants and animals.</p>

      <h2>My Recipies</h2>
      <p>My Recipe Blog is going to be a new long journey for me. I’ll be posting my favourite veg dishes and experimented ones as well. If you like my recipes, please share your comments and also share my recipes with your family & friends.</p>

        <h3>COMPLETO, CHILE</h3>
        <p>Its unique natural barriers—the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Andes Mountains to the east and the Atacama Desert to the north—help protect vulnerable avocado trees from pests and disease. To sample a Chilean avocado staple, order a completo. </p>

        <h3>MEZE, MIDDLE EAST</h3>
        <p>Can’t decide what to eat off the menu? Order meze (also spelled mezze). It’s this part of the world’s version of Spanish tapas. Depending on where you are, meze could include a variety of local dishes that may include labne (strained yogurt cheese), baba ghanoush (seasoned diced eggplant).</p>

        <h3>GNOCCHI, URUGUAY</h3>
        <p>Unless you’ve been to Uruguay on the 29th of the month, you’ve probably never heard of Dia de Noquis, or Gnocchi Day. The custom of eating gnocchi on the 29th is simple. By the end of the month money has run out, and the combination of potatoes, flour, and an egg.</p>

        <h3>Crish Morrish</h3>
        <p>I had breakfast there this morning and dinner tonight. All were well beyond my expectations. Everything is so fresh. Best clam chowder I have ever had. Clams and linguine were out of this world. Breakfast will knock your slippers off.</p>

        <h3>James Anderson</h3>
        <p>We like to go to The Fairway every time we come to the Cape. The food is always delicious! This is the first year we could make reservations (probably due to spacing because of the virus). Our waitress, Casey, was great!</p>

        <p>They are great for any meal, but I had breakfast there this time. Such a selection including creamed chipped beef, biscuits and gravy, potato pancakes, waffles, pancakes, egg scrambles, eggs benedict, and so much more.</p>
